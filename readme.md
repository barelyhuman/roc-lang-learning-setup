# roc-lang setup

very basic setup of roc-lang with a local executable binary setup.

This setup is only for Mac Silicon systems, please make changes to the `Makefile` accordingly for your system.

You'll still need `llvm` for the compilations to work so do install it.

```
brew install llvm@16
```
